<p>Ben Levy sent me this demonstration of <a href="http://neb.net/playground/dragdrop/" title="requires Safari or Firefox">drag &amp; drop between lists</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't know if you are interested, but I was playing with one of your examples of the drag and drop sortable lists and made some changes to allow dragging between multiple lists. I don't really know how useful that would be, but it seems to work for the most part.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it's pretty damn useful. I especially like that he highlights the drop targets.</p>
