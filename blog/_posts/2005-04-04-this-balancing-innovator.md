My response to Stuart Langridge's article ["The innovation balance"][1] which cited my [Drag & Drop Sortable Lists][2]:

I take no offense to [the article][1]. To the contrary, it contributed to my 15 minutes of fame. I agree with the reader comments that a technique that doesn't work in IE is at most an interesting experiment. Which gets right to the original purpose of my [Drag & Drop Sortable Lists][2]. It was an interesting experiment. It happened just like this: one day I came across [Simon Cozens' sortable lists][3]. "Neato," thought I. Followed by, "I could make some improvements...that would be fun." I did and it was.

Brief history of my personal platform dogma: Windows Bigot, Linux Revolutionary, Linux Refugee/Mac Snob. Where we arrive at today with me still using a Mac. But I've settled into a Whatever-Platform-Works-for-You zen comfort zone with occasional bursts of "Nyah nyah, my Apple product works better than your suxx0r wannabe product". Take anything "iPod" for instance. Anyhow, that my examples currently only work in Safari and Firefox is coincident with me being a Mac guy. A lazy Mac guy even, since my partner's Toshiba laptop was sitting on the coffee table the entire time I worked on those examples. I'm imagining somewhere in the multiverse another me is typing away on his Windows laptop describing why his DnD Sortable Lists currently only work in Internet Explorer, guiltily looking at his partner's PowerBook G4 sitting idle...
