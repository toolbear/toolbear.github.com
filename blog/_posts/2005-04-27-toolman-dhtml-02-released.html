<p>A new version, version 0.2, of the ToolMan DHTML Library has been released. You can <a href="http://tool-man.org/examples/">try out the examples</a> (Drag &amp; Drop Sorting, Edit in Place) and <a href="http://tool-man.org/examples/">download it here</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the Top 5 Reasons to be Excited about Version 0.2:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>IE support. Most examples have been verified to work properly in IE6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rewritten from scratch; designed for reuse. The new library is more<br />
modular, better packaged, and less likely to have name collisions with<br />
your code and other 3rd party libraries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's free! Permission granted for personal and commercial use via the<br />
liberal MIT license.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved quality. Cleaner, less duplicated code. Where possible,<br />
library modules have <a href="http://tool-man.org/tests/TestRunner.html">unit tests written using Selenium</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is only version 0.2. It just gets better from here.</p>
</li>
</ol>
