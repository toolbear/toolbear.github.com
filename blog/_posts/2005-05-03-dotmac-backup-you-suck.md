Dear .Mac Backup,

You suck:

![a dialog box with Backup icon, the text "Alert", two buttons labelled "Stop" and "Continue", and nothing else]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/dotMacBackupYouSuck.png)

Sincerely,<br>
Fed Up With Beat Software

At this point I've given up on Backup and switched to [Carbon Copy Cloner](http://www.bombich.com/software/ccc.html)
