## Nerd stuff

* AWS Cloudfront and S3 hosted static site.
* [HTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/HTTPS-EVERYWHERE)! Wildcard TLS cert from a member of [the CA cartel](https://ssl.comodo.com/); were I smarter I'd have
  gone with a free cert from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
* Jekyll static blog ported from hosted wordpress
